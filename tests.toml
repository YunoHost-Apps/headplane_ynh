    ## Conventions in this sample:
    ## <- An actual comment
    # <- uncommenting this should be a valid entry in 'tests.toml'

    ## NB: the tests to run are automatically deduced by the CI script according to the
    ## content of the app's manifest. The declarations below allow to customize which
    ## tests are ran, possibly add special test suite to test special args, or
    ## declare which commits to test upgrade from.
    ##
    ## You can also decide (though this is discouraged!) to ban/ignore some tests,
    ## The test IDs to be used in only/exclude statements are:
    ## * install.root
    ## * install.subdir
    ## * install.nourl
    ## * install.multi
    ## * backup_restore
    ## * upgrade
    ## * upgrade.someCommitId
    ## * change_url
    ## NB: you should NOT need this except if you really have a good reason...

    # exclude = ["install.private", "install.multi"]

    ## For special usecases, sometimes you need to setup other things on the machine
    ## prior to installing the app (such as installing another app)
    ## (Remove this key entirely if not needed)
