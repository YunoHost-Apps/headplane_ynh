As of package version 0.6.1~ynh1, Headplane deploys an "agent" that will appear like a machine on your VPN to make it better communicate with Headscale: two new tabs will appear in Headscale, DNS and Settings.

To smoothen this integration, the package now requires that Headscale is also installed on the same server. Headplane will run with the same system user as Headscale.

The upgrade script should detect the Headscale app automatically, or will stop if it does not. Do not hesitate to report any issue if you do have the app installed, but the upgrade fails to find it.

This version also adds a remote SSH feature. This is **not** working yet on YunoHost.
