If you were using Headplane previously, you might have experienced difficulties reaching it.
The upstream app is a bit wonky when one tries to install it on a different path than `/admin`.
To properly use it, the app thus needs a dedicated domain, and can then be reached on the `/admin` path of that domain.

If you have set up the app on a path different than `/admin`, please try to change its path before upgrading, or delete then reinstall it.
(For your convenience, your current path is `__PATH__`)

Enjoy!
